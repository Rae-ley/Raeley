## 👋 Hi, I'm @Rae-ley

📊 BSc Digital Technology Solutions : Data Analytics
📈 Data Engineer

I love all things information. The data that helps us form opinons, answer questions, And how it gets from source systems into a form that can be used by your everyday person. 

I've come all the way from Electrical Engineering, through to programming and then data. The bit that interests me is the gubbins behind the scene.

Some of the technical skills I've picked up along the way are:
- T-SQL
- PostgreSQL
- BigQuery
- Matillion ETL
- Python
- Java
- Javascript
- Git bash
