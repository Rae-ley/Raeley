## 👋 Hi, I'm Rae 

📊 Data Analyst Student
📈 Productivity Technician

I can use the following languages to varying degrees:

- T-SQL
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Java
- Angular cli
- Git bash

I'm using github to store all my personal projects and professional portfolio; I'm hoping that I will build confidence to where I feel comfortable contributing to the community, but for now I'm just here to learn
